EventAttribute
==============

EventAttribute allows you to turn your date/datetime columns in to boolean attributes.
Idea for this was taken from http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2005/12/14/two-tips-for-working-with-databases-in-rails


Example
=======

  class Referral < ActiveRecord::Base
    event_attribute :applied_at, :attribute => 'pending', :nil_equals => true
    event_attribute :subscribed_on
  end

  referral = Referral.create(:applied_at => Time.now)
  referral.pending?           # => false
  referral.subscribed?        # => false
  
  referral.pending = true
  referral.applied_at         # => nil
  referral.pending?           # => true
  
  referral.subscribed = true
  referral.subscribed_at      # => Time.now
  referral.subscribed?        # => true
  
  
  # Dynamic finders are also added so that you can search on these boolean attributes.
  Referral.find_all_by_pending(true)  # => [Referral objects]

  # or
  Referral.find_by_name_and_pending_and_subscribed('John Smith', false, true)  # => Referral object
